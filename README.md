# RestaurantPOS - Restaurant Management System

**RestaurantPOS** is a practical and maintainable Restaurant Management System backend developed as a showcase of modern .NET Web API development practices, focusing on clear code structure, SOLID principles, and effective REST API design.

---

## Overview

This project provides a RESTful API designed to efficiently manage common restaurant operations including:

- Menu items management with dynamic categories
- Customer records and reservations
- Order processing
- Payment handling
- Table management and reservation validation

The project serves as a solid example of how to build scalable, readable, and maintainable APIs using the latest .NET 9 features, Entity Framework Core, AutoMapper, and structured exception handling.

## Features

- **Comprehensive REST API**

  - Supports CRUD operations for Categories, Menu Items, Orders, Customers, Reservations, Tables, and Payments.

- **Robust Validation**

  - Ensures data integrity through validation checks, such as verifying category existence before creating menu items.

- **Structured Exception Handling**

  - Uses custom middleware for consistent HTTP responses across various scenarios (Resource Not Found, Validation errors, etc.).

- **In-Memory Database**

  - Utilizes Entity Framework Coreâ€™s In-memory provider to simplify development and testing.

- **Clear and Modular Codebase**

  - Follows SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles to ensure clarity and ease of future extensions.

- **API Documentation**
  - Integrated Swagger UI for simple and effective documentation and testing of API endpoints.
